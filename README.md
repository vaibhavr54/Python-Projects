### 4. Face Detection-Based Live Attendance System Using OpenCV

- **Introduction:**
  - The Face Detection-Based Live Attendance System is an innovative application that utilizes facial recognition technology to automate attendance tracking. Developed in Python, this application leverages OpenCV and the face_recognition library to identify individuals in real-time using a webcam feed. The system allows for easy registration of new faces and automatic attendance logging.

- **Features and Technologies:**
  - Real-Time Face Recognition: Identifies and recognizes registered faces using a live webcam feed.
  - Automatic Attendance Logging: Records attendance in a CSV file with timestamps for each recognized individual.
  - Face Registration: Users can capture and register new faces by providing names and saving images.
  - Dynamic Display of Names: Recognized names are displayed in real-time beneath the corresponding face.
  - Persistent Name Display: Maintains the name display for a set duration after the face leaves the frame.
- **Technologies Used:**
  - Python: The primary programming language used for developing the application.
  - OpenCV: A powerful library for computer vision tasks, used for real-time video processing and face detection.
  - face_recognition: A Python library built on top of dlib's state-of-the-art face recognition technology, used for identifying and recognizing faces.
  - Tkinter: The standard GUI toolkit for Python, utilized for creating the graphical user interface.


### 5. OMR Scanner and Test Grader Using OpenCV

 - **Overview**

     An automated **OMR Scanner and Test Grader** built with **OpenCV** to grade multiple-choice tests. It processes images of test sheets, recognizes marked answers, compares them to a predefined answer key, and      calculates the score.


- üí° **Features**

  - **Real-Time Answer Detection**: Identifies marked answers.
  - **Automated Grading**: Compares answers to the key and calculates the score.
  - **Output**: Displays the score on the test sheet and saves the result.


- üõ†Ô∏è Technologies

  - **Python**
  - **OpenCV**
  - **imutils**
  - **NumPy**
